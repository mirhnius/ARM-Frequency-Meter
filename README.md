# ARM_Frequency_Meter
In this project, a Frequency Meter is implemented using STM32F401 microcontroller and STM32CubeIDE. Also the systems is simulated in Proteus to test the functionality.

* ### STM32F401
  The STM32F401 microcontrollers are part of the STM32 Dynamic Efficiency™ device range. These devices offer the best balance of dynamic power consumption (in run mode) and processing performance, while integrating a high number of added-value features in packages as small as 3 x 3 mm.

  The MCUs deliver the performance of Cortex®-M4 core with floating point unit, running at 84 MHz, while achieving outstandingly low power consumption values in run and stop modes.
