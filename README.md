# ARM-Frequency-Meter
In this project, a Frequency Meter is implemented using **STM32F401** microcontroller and **STM32CubeIDE**. Also the systems is simulated in **Proteus** to test the functionality.

* ### STM32F401
  The STM32F401 microcontrollers are part of the STM32 Dynamic Efficiency™ device range. These devices offer the best balance of dynamic power consumption (in run mode) and processing performance, while integrating a high number of added-value features in packages as small as 3 x 3 mm.

  The MCUs deliver the performance of Cortex®-M4 core with floating point unit, running at 84 MHz, while achieving outstandingly low power consumption values in run and stop modes.
  * #### Integration: 
    The STM32F401 portfolio provides from 128 to 512 Kbytes of Flash, 96 Kbytes of SRAM. The available packages range from 49 to 100 pins.

    * 3x USARTs running at up to 10.5 Mbit/s
    * 4x SPI running at up to 42 Mbit/s
    * 3x I²C
    * 1x SDIO
    * 1x USB 2.0 OTG full speed
    * 2x full duplex I²S up to up to 32-bit/192KHz
    * 12-bit ADC reaching 2.4 MSPS
    * 10 timers, 16- and 32-bit, running at up to 84 MHz
